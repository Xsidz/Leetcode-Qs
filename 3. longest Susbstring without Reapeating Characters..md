Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest** **substring** without duplicate characters.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abcabcbb"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Approach :

We use sliding window approach where, if any duplicate occurs we move the window forward.

Steps : 

1. Create a hashset of character type, initialize left = 0 and maxlen  = 0
2. traverse through the string with a right pointer 
3. check while the hashset has the value if yes
	1. remove the element from the left and left++, until the duplicate value has been removed
4. if no add the value to the hashset
5. calculate max len by comapring the currnt maxlen and right-left+1
