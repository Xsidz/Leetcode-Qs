There are `n` people in a line queuing to buy tickets, where the `0th` person is at the **front** of the line and the `(n - 1)th` person is at the **back** of the line.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `tickets` of length `n` where the number of tickets that the `ith` person would like to buy is `tickets[i]`.

Each person takes **exactly 1 second** to buy a ticket. A person can only buy **1 ticket at a time** and has to go back to **the end** of the line (which happens **instantaneously**) in order to buy more tickets. If a person does not have any tickets left to buy, the person will **leave** the line.

Return the **time taken** for the person **initially** at position **k** (0-indexed) to finish buying tickets.


steps : 
1. initialize a que of integer array type and time of int type to 0
2. add all tickets to queue with their index number i in form of array;
3. while my q is not empty 
	1. poll the front element 
	2. decrease the the ticket value by one front[1]--;
	3. time++
	4. check if the fromt[1] > 0
		1. if yeess add it to queue
		2. else check if front[0] is k if yes break and return the time;
