Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]

**Output:** [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

**Explanation:**

- There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form `"bat"`.
- The strings `"nat"` and `"tan"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
- The strings `"ate"`, `"eat"`, and `"tea"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.


Approach :

here we need to group the Strings toegther. We can convert the string into char array ,  sort them. , also convert to string again. And check if it is present in the Hashmap if yes we can retrive the index of the record and using that index we can get record form array list and add the original string to list. Else add the sorted String to map with an index as arraylist.size  and add the original string to array list.


Steps :
1. initialize a new Hashmap mp and an Arraylist which stores list of strings as ans
2. for every string in the strign array convert to char array
3. sort the char array
4. create a new string as sorted string and store the character array as new string in the sorted str
5. check if map conatainsKey sorted str 
		1. if yes then from map get the index of the sorted str and pass it to ans.get() to get the list and add the origininal string to the list 
		2. if not then put the sorted string in the map and pass the index as ans.size()
		3. and add new list to ans as new ArrayList(ArryaList.asList(string))
6. return the ans
