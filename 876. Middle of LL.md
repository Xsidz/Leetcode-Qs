Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return _the middle node of the linked list_.

If there are two middle nodes, return **the second middle** node.


steps :

Here we use fast and slow approach to find the middle of the LL

1. initialize the fast and slow nodes as equal to head

In this approach the fast node moves two nodes at a time and slow moves one node. The point is when fast == null the slow node is at center node and we need to return the same

2. traverse the ll till the fast != null and fast.next != null
        1. slow = slow.next
        2. fast = fast.next.next
3. return slow
