You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists into one **sorted** list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return _the head of the merged linked list_.

here we need to merge the two sorted lists, so we would create a new temp node which would be traversed by an dummy node.we will traverse the both the lists silultaneously by comparing the values.

if the node1.data > node2.data then our temp.next will point the node2.data as its smaller , update temp = temp.next so the smaller node is the temp node now and node2 = node2.next so at the next comparison the temp.next will point next node which is smaller in the comparison

steps :

1. initialize a temp node and traverse it with the dummy node
2. while node1 and node2 != null
3. compare the node1.data and node2.data value
4. which ever is the smaller value make the dummy.next = smaller node 
5. update dummynode = dummynode.next so it would be now the saller node 
6. and smaller ndoe = smallernode.next
7. if any of the list is larger then other then just put a condition temp.next = (list1 != null) ? list1 : list2;
8. return the dummy.next
