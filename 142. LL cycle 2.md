Given the `head` of a linked list, return _the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return_ `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to (**0-indexed**). It is `-1` if there is no cycle. **Note that** `pos` **is not passed as a parameter**.

**Do not modify** the linked list.


Here like the previous [[141. LL Cycle]] question we need to find cycle afn return the node where the cycle begin. So using fast and slow pinters we will detect the cycle and break the loop. Then wel will initilaize the fast pointer at the head and then update it once at a time until the slow and fast meet at a node. Node where the both pointers are equal or meet is the starting node of the cycle.

steps:

1.Follow steps from the 141.LL Cycle
2. once the pointers are qual break and initialixze the fast at head
3. while fast != slow update slow as slow.next and fast as fast.next
4. once the loop breaks return slow/ fast both are same and your asnswer
