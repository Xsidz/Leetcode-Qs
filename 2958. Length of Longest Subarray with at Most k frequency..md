You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

The **frequency** of an element `x` is the number of times it occurs in an array.

An array is called **good** if the frequency of each element in this array is **less than or equal** to `k`.

Return _the length of the **longest** **good** subarray of_ `nums`_._

A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.


Approach :

we use hashmap to store the frequency of the element, get the element and increase its frequency then check if the frequency is greater than provided if yes, then while freq of the curr num > k , reduce the frequency of the of left and left++


steps :

1. Initialize a hash map which stores 2 integers along with the maxLen and left = 0
2. traverse on the array using right as index
	1. pick the element at the right index
	2. update the frq in hashmap by passing num and getorDefault function which gets the freq or set it to 0. and all +1 
3. check while frequency of the current is greater than k then, pick left and update the frequency of left element by -1  and left++;
4. then calculate the maxLen by comaparing the current maxLen and right-left+1;
5. return maxLen
