Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return _the **minimum window**_ **_substring_** _of_ `s` _such that every character in_ `t` _(**including duplicates**) is included in the window_. If there is no such substring, return _the empty string_ `""`.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
**Output:** "BANC"
**Explanation:** The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

Approach :

create a new array to store the frequecny of the cahracters, a count variable with value of length of the t,
start, end = 0 and minLen of Integer.Max_value and strtt index = 0;

for every charcter in the t update its frequency in the map array by map[c]++;

convert the string s in to character array chs;

while end is less than length of chs check if the in the map the character at end of chs is greater than 0 if yess then count--, 
end++
freq of value at chs of end in map--;

also in same loop check another contion that 
while count becomes 0 then update minLen by checking if end-start is less than minLen then start = startindex and minlen is end-start

also check if the freq of value at chs of start is equal to 0 then count ++,
and start++;
freq of value at chs of start in map ++

return the minLen = new String(chs, StartIndex,minLen)
