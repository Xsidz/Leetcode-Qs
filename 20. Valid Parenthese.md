Given a string `s` containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "()"

**Output:** true


Approach :

here we need to check if the parentheses are valid i.e complete or not. Its quite simple whenever we see a opening parenthese we just ned to push in the stack, and when a closing parenthese occurs we need to check the top , if its a valid pair or not, if yes pop the top or else return false and exit.

also check if the stack is empty, i its is then all pairs are valid or else they are invalid.


steps :

1. create a stack
2. if openign brace occur push it in stack
3. if closing brace occurs then :
         1. check if the top has its pair of opening brace, yes them pop
         2. no then rerun false
4. if the stack is empty then return true that the braces are valid
5. or else return false.
