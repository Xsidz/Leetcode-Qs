(Binary Search, array )
You are given an integer `n` indicating there are `n` specialty retail stores. There are `m` product types of varying amounts, which are given as a **0-indexed** integer array `quantities`, where `quantities[i]` represents the number of products of the `ith` product type.

You need to distribute **all products** to the retail stores following these rules:

- A store can only be given **at most one product type** but can be given **any** amount of it.
- After distribution, each store will have been given some number of products (possibly `0`). Let `x` represent the maximum number of products given to any store. You want `x` to be as small as possible, i.e., you want to **minimize** the **maximum** number of products that are given to any store.

Return _the minimum possible_ `x`.


Here we are given a array of products, where each index is diff type of product and value indicate the max quantity available.

we need to distribute the products such that each vendor gets one type of product and return the min quantity that needs to be distributed.

Steps :

1. find the max quantity from the array of products and set it as high and low as 1
2. as we need to find the min quantity, we find the mid value of the quantity
3. then we calculate stores needed , when we consider the mid value to be assigned to each store so we get min store required to fulfill the quantity.
4. so for each quantity in the array we divide by the mid value as max value and take the ceil value and add to max store variable.
5. after all iteration if the max store value is less then return true. 
6. Update the high to be mid, so now we will find the value from 1 to the mid value.
7. if store are more then we need to increase the quantity assigned to each store, so update the low = mid + 1
8. Again repeat step 3,4 & 5
9. then return low value
