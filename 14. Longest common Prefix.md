Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty stringÂ `""`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
**Output:** "fl"


Approach :

here we need to print the longest common prefix. Prefix is something that comes first and postfix is something that appears last. So we need to compare initial letters of the string and give the longest common prefix among all.


Steps :

1. Create a new Stringbuilder
2. sort the arrat of strings by Arrays.sort
3. initialize a start String by the first string in the array and a last string by last element in the String array
4. now iterate over the start and last Strings keeping base condition for i min(statrt.len, last.len)
5. if start.charAt(i) != last.charAt(i) we simply return the stringbuilder sb
6. else we append the charAt(i) into the sb and return the sb.toString
