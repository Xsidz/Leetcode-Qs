Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return **the median** of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be `O(log (m+n))`.


Steps :

1. Create a new array with the size m+n
2.while i & j are less then lenght of num1 & num12  traverse through two arrays and compare each element with each other , and put the smaller element in the new array, continue till the new array is full.
2. if any array length is completed before another, run loop to fill the new arrasy with the remains of the remaining array from the two.
3. then if length of array is even then take median as mid+ mid-1/2 else mid/2
4. return the mid as median of the array.!
