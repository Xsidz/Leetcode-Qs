You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.

Return _the single element that appears only once_.

Your solution must run in `O(log n)` time and `O(1)` space.


Steps :

1. Check the lenght of the given array
2. if mid index is even && mid == mid + 1 || index is odd && mid == mid-1 then update the low value to mid+1
3. if not then update the high value to mid-1;
4. repeat till low < high and return the low value
