Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, return `true` if `s2` contains a permutation of `s1`, or `false` otherwise.

In other words, return `true` if one of `s1`'s permutations is the substring of `s2`.

Approach :

we will using sliding window approach to check if theres a permutation of the strign given. here we will initialize two array of size 26. forst array will have frequency of the part strign that is to be checked by charAt(i)-'a'.

and another array that is our window that will take length of our part string and we will calculate the frequency of the elements in that range if both the arrays are equal then we can say there exist an permutation of the part string

Steps :

1. Initialize two arrays with 26 size as partcount and window count
2. Run the loop till size of the part string and update the arrays by charAt(i)-'a'
3. check if both arrays are equal if yes then return
4. if nto run a loop till length of the string and update the window by removing the last element and adding next element in the array and checking if both are equal.
         1. remove by string.charAt(i-part.length())-'a'
         2. add by string.charAt(i)-'a'
5. if all the conditions fail return false
