Given a circular integer array `nums` (i.e., the next element of `nums[nums.length - 1]` is `nums[0]`), return _the **next greater number** for every element in_ `nums`.

The **next greater number** of a number `x` is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return `-1` for this number.



this is the continuation problem of the [[496. Next Greater Element I]], the diff is here we need to find the next greater element in the circular fashion. The only step diff is when we compare in the prev problem the stack was empty, here we need to fill the stack with the array starting from the last index to first.

Steps :

1. calculate the length of nums array
2. initialize the new stack
3. create a new answer array
4. copy the elements from array to the stack starting from the i-1 to 0
5. then start iteration form the last element and check if the greater element exixt in the stack if not
		1. pop the element at top
		2. if stack emepty then store -1 at ans[i]
		3. else the element greater in the stack store it at ans[i]
6. push the current element in the stack 
7. and iterate over next element
