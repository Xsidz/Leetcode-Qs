Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.



Here we user fast and slow pointer approach , where the slow pointer traverse one node at a time, where as the fast pointer traverse two nodes at a time. When these two nodes meet each other at the same node, these exist a cycle


Steps :
1. initialize two new nodes as fast and slow with head
2. while fast and fast.next != null, update slow as slow.next and fast as fast.next
3. once the they are equal break the loop and return true , else false
4. ![[Pasted image 20250724142337.png]]
