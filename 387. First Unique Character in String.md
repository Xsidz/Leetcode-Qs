**Given a string `s`, find the **first** non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it **does not** exist, return `-1`**

steps :

1. Initialize an empty array as freq top store the freq of the characters 
2. traverse through the string and store the frequency of each character by subtracting through 'a'.
3. traverse through the freq array and once an index with frequency of 1 is found return the index and break

Alternate approach :

initialize queue and store the frequency in the array of the element and check if the peek element of the queue has freq > 1 if yess pop the peek. else check if queue is empty if yess return -1. If everything goes well then return the peek index.
