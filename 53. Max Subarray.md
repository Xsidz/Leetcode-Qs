Given an integer array `nums`, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return _its sum_.

steps :

1. We will use kadens algorithm to find the subarray with largest sum.
2. we will calculate the current sum by adding the elements linearly into a variable called sum.
3. Also after addign each elemtn in sum compare it with a max variable which will have max from both ones.
4. if the current sum is negative then update the current sum to 0
5. and return the max at the end!
